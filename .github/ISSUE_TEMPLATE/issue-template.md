<!--

Before opening an issue on this repo, please take a few minutes to consider whether it’s the right place. If you have a doubt, please feel free to post here anyway, and we’ll figure out the best way to approach the problem.

This codemod makes the minimal code changes required to build your app with Vite. It is expected not to change your build options or anything unnecessary to build. See https://github.com/mainmatter/ember-vite-codemod/blob/main/README.md#promise-and-compatibility

Let’s assume this codemod doesn’t exist and you had to migrate to Vite manually. Would you still have posted an issue on a public repo because your problem relates to a part of the ecosystem, and if so, which one? This is probably the place you should post the issue.

On the other hand, if your issue relates to the changes made by the codemod, then opening an issue here makes sense.
